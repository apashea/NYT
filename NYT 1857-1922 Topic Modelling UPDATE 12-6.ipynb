    "1. Reduce corpus to only relevant files (note: 'corpus' from now on will refer to this reduced, relevant corpus') which contain a list of keywords (e.g., censorship, ban, suppress; potentially only 'censorship' as relates to semantic/discourse analysis of a particular term and its employment and movement)\n",
    "2. We will then clean the code, removing all unnecessary information and only keeping important information held in the files. For example, we will keep the FullText section, publication date, possibly the title (and subtitle).\n",
    "3. Make code that chronologically orders the corpus. There is a numeric publication date that might be easier to follow. Or, for the alpha pub date: Each file is dated in the style of, for example, \"May 20, 1892\". We need code that can acknowledge these dates as ordered; May is after April and before June, May 20 is before May 21 and after May 19, May 20, 1892 is before May 20, 1893 and after May 20, 1891, etc.)\n",
    "4. From here, we will process the chronologically-ordered and -recognized corpus in such a way that we can find latent features in the corpus:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. We can do this for the entire corpus to see if a continued latent theme (or set of themes) appears to see if 'censorship' itself has, from 1857 to 1922, contained a theme we did not expect.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. We can do this for time segments (which I refer to as the 'episteme model') whereby we segment the dates and THEN find latent features for each individual segment. What are the (unexpected) themes to be found in certain time periods? We can then cross-reference this with secondary/tertiary sources produced by historians to see what is happenening during these periods of time.\n",
    "        Ex.1 We can segment periods arbitrarily, such as\n",
    "                Period 1 = 1857-1876\n",
    "                Period 2 = 1877-1896\n",
    "                Period 3 = 1897-1916\n",
    "                Period 4 = 1916-1922\n",
    "        Ex.2 We can segment periods which align with major events, such as\n",
    "                Period 1 = Civil War\n",
    "                Period 2 = Post-Civil War\n",
    "                Period 3 = World War 1\n",
    "                Period 4 = Film Industry emerges\n",
    "        Ex.3 We can have OVERLAPS between time segments rather than cutting them off from one another. \n",
    "                Period 1 = Civil War AND Post-Civil War\n",
    "                Period 2 = Post-Civil War AND World War 1\n",
    "                Period 3 = World War 1 AND Film Industry emerges\n",
    "             This could be done, say, in addition to Ex.1 or Ex.2 so that a) through Ex.1 or Ex.2 we can see what changes between periods and b) through Ex.3 we can see what CONTINUES between those segments.\n",
